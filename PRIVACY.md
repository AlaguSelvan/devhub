### Personal user information
This app requires GitHub authentication.<br/>
DevHub requests access to the user's profile data, e-mail and notifications.

We might contact you via e-mail (rarely) to share things like big updates or important announcements, with the option to unsubscribe any time.

### Repository and org access
You have the option to install DevHub's GitHub App in some specific orgs and repositories.
This is required to enable access to activities from private repositories.

DevHub will only request the permissions that are required to show you useful GitHub events. Due to a GitHub API limitation, code access may be requested for private repositories, but DevHub will never access any code.

No personal information is ever sent to third parties, only an anonymous id. Services may collect the user's IP. Some device information may be included for debugging purposes, like `brand`, `model` and `operation system`.
